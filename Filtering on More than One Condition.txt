EXAMPLE 

SELECT TITLE FROM BOOKS WHERE AUTOHOR = "J" AND FIRST_PUBLISHED <2000;

You can compare multiple values in a WHERE condition. If you want to test that both conditions are true use the AND keyword, or either conditions are true use the OR keyword.

SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> AND <condition 2> ...;
SELECT <columns> FROM <table> WHERE <condition 1> OR <condition 2> ...;
Examples:


SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = "Games Consoles" AND price < 400;



SELECT country FROM countries WHERE population < 1000000 OR population > 100000000;
