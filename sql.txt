how to create a db :

	create table tbl1(one varchar(10), two smallint);
	   create table koushan (a int, b real ,c text);
	   insert into koushan values(1,2,3);
	   this is same as :
	   		insert into koushan values(1,2,3)

	checking the type of row:
		select a , typeof(a) from koushan;

	what is the blob type:
		is a picture but in sql is text type

	if and elese in sql:

		select
		case when a then "true" else "false" end as boolA,
		case when b then "false" else "true" end as boolb
		from booltest;

	date and time:
		insert into time_1 values(datetime('now'),datetime('now','localtime'));

	adding from one table to another table:

	update:
		update tbl1 set one ='TesT'

	select :
		select "hello world"; >> echo
		select "hello world" as name;
		select one as '1', two as '2' from tbl1
